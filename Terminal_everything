#CMH Scan

#SNPs called with new reference genome from 2022 common garden: /project/kreiner/pairedenv_commongarden/
	#Files:
		#Sig snps w new ref genome for me to use: commongarden_allfiltsnps_193_hap2.vcf.gz
		#oldgenome_CMH result folder has old CMH scan with old genome
		
#SNPs with new ref genome from drought experiment: /cds3/kreiner/drought/
	#Files:
		#Scaffolded, nonmerged snps from each scaffold: raw/*
		#Merged snps: vcf_dont_touch/ 
			#In merged file "scaffold_1" will just be "1" in the vcf
    #merged drought with scaffold: /cds3/kreiner/drought/raw/merged.vcf
				
#Run CMH scan on new ref snps to see effect of new reference with longer reads
#Run CMH scan on new ref snps + drought experiment snps to see effect of larger sample size

#"The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) tests are valid with both a large number of small clusters and a small number of large clusters. These tests provide a test based on an "average" odds ratio that controls for the potential confounding due to the cluster variable." (https://zzz.bwh.harvard.edu/plink/anal.shtml)
#"To use the Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test when you have data from  2×2
  tables that you've repeated at different times or locations. It will tell you whether you have a consistent difference in proportions across the repeats."

#Julia found error: "aha! i think i realized where the issue is coming from
I used bcftools view --regions "Scaffold_10" commongarden_allfiltsnps_193_hap2.vcf.gz > scaf10check to quickly print a subset of scaffold 10
those rows have phased genotype calls (you can tell cause the are 0|0 as opposed to 0/1)
I think the counts row in those cases are counts of the alternative haplotypes, as opposed to counts of the alternative allele (and indeed, the site is biallelic)"
